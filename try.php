After installation of the box, the torque increase already in the lower speed range is appreciable. The fuel savings are in my case about 0.5l per 100km. The default setting of the box has not been altered by me. After 2000 km so far there were no problems. The shipment of DTE Systems is very fast.

                <p>Extra power and torque are independently measured by TÜV Austria and are approved in the included part approval certificate.</p>
                The performance data was measured over several runs using different test vehicles and in accordance with standard test methods. Our MAHA dynamometers are regularly monitored and calibrated in accordance with standard expert evaluation regulations.<br><br>The performance data are determined by a <strong>VdTÜV-compliant differential measurement</strong> between the serial power of the measuring vehicle and the power consumed. Performance values are standardized according to the standard valid since 1980 in conformity with <strong>EWG 80/1269</strong>. Older measuring methods that are no longer compliant with the standard (eg according to DIN 70020 or ISO 1585) show about 15% higher performance values. Slippage, which would lead to a false identity card significantly higher performance values, is not included by DTE standards.

                Manufacturing tolerances and different fuel qualities may result in differences in performance figures. We recommend that you use high-quality fuels such as petrol with an octane rating of at least 98.<br><br>It’s possible to save up to 15% in fuel costs, however these savings may depend on an adapted part throttle driving style under the same conditions.

                <p>With DTE’s PowerControl, drivers have the option to choose their own and fully customizable driving program: <strong>Sport</strong>, <strong>Dynamic</strong> and <strong>Efficiency</strong>.</p>
                <p>Note: The Efficiency program is only available for PowerControl X.</p>
                <p><strong>Sport</strong><br> In Sport mode, the engine’s parameters are modified for maximum performance. The vehicle reacts more directly for a more responsive driving experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Dynamic</strong><br> The Dynamic mode is a great all-rounder and very well balanced for long distances. The vehicle reacts more dynamically for better agility throughout the rpm range.</p>
                <p><strong>Efficiency</strong> (for PowerControl X only)<br> The Efficiency mode is focused on improving the engine’s fuel consumption. Savings of up to 15% can be achieved.</p>

                <p>The DTE tuning box PowerControl X has a selectable efficiency mode. This eco program reduces fuel consumption by up to 15%. With an optimized torque, extra power is already available at low rpm’s. Now you can change gears sooner and drive longer in lower gears to save fuel. That's how the tuning pays off quickly.</p>

                    <p>DTE’s PowerControl allows you to drive at much lower revs per minute, which significantly reduces fuel consumption. Gear changes can be made earlier and more fuel can be saved with each crankshaft revolution.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pull off and immediately change to 2nd gear</li>

                        <li>No constant down changing as the engine has more torque</li>

                    <p>Depending on your driving style, it’s possible to save up to 15% in fuel usage, quickly recouping your investment costs. The main savings are due to higher engine torque figures, with power available in the lower rpm range, your driving style soon adapts, and voilà, money in the bank!</p>
