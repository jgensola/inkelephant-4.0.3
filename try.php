    <h2 style="font-weight: 100; color: #cd1816;">Germany's leading manufacturer of performance engine and accelerator pedal tuning products</h2>
    <img src="https://autovox.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DTE_Geb_ude_f_r_Shop.jpg" alt="DTE German Headquarter" />DTE Systems in Germany develops, produces and sells high performance tuning products for cars, trucks, tractors and boats. The PowerControl, for cars, SUV’s, tractors and trucks plugs into connectors on the engine which increases engine power by up to 30% and also helps reduce fuel consumption by up to 15%. DTE’s other product, the PedalBox plugs into connectors on the accelerator pedal and shortens the reaction time of the throttle’s response which eliminates lag, increases acceleration speed and improves fuel consumption and is suitable for all vehicles with an electronic accelerator.
    <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">DTE Systems’ Milestones</h2>
    DTE Systems was started by founder and then owner Patrick von Drunen in 1996 and soon established European trade partners in Italy, the Netherlands, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Turkey and Norway. In 2003 the company relocated to the Ortloh Business Park, a trendy and modern business area in Recklinghausen, and merged the R&amp;D and production departments. During this time DTE underwent rapid expansion quickly growing to 21 employees.

    Ten years later in 2013, and still in Recklinghausen, the company moved into their ultra-modern and newly built offices in Maria von Linden Street, merging R&amp;D, manufacturing and logistics all under one roof. Super-fast turnaround times and excellent logistics are all made possible thanks to in-house cable and module manufacturing, which also ensures that DTE is able to maintain the best quality standards possible.

In 2016 DTE launched their brand new website, which boasts a whole host of new features, including a vehicle configuration tool, handy drop down toolbars offering lots more useful tuning information.

    <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Our mission: Better and safer performance</h2>
    Ensuring our tuning products are safe and reliable for everyday use is our main objective, because your vehicle is our priority! We are also a member VDAT, The Association of Automobile Tuners, your piece of mind that we aspire to the highest quality tuning standards. And if that wasn’t enough, we can already provide TÜV parts certifications on our PowerControl’s for more than 3,300 vehicles.

    High quality components such as heat resistant automotive fiberglass housings, high performance CPU’s (for real-time calculations) and OEM quality connector plugs are just some of the examples of our relentless pursuit of tuning perfection!
    <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">DTE Quality Management</h2>
    An in-house audit was carried out by the RWTÜV Systems GmbH in accordance with the guidelines of ISO 9001 in 2003, and once again in 2006 by TÜV Austria. This verification forms the basis for us being able to provide TÜV certifications for our tuning systems which is necessary in Germany and some other countries. This attention to detail ensures complete peace of mind for our customers, knowing that we are dedicated to safety, quality and customer satisfaction.
